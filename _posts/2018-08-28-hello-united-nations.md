The United Nations had its monthly SDG dialogue on Tuesday, 28th August 2018 at the United Nations Information center in Ikoyi, Lagos. The theme of the month’s dialogue was **“Achieving Gender Equality in Nigeria - Challenges and Prospects”**. I attended as a representative of Sanitary Aid Initiative.

The event was amazing and eye-opening. Gender equality in Nigeria was extensively discussed by various prominent speakers including Ms Eke Oban Patience representing UN Women, and Dr Joe Odumakin, the President of Arise Africa. I was thrilled by Dr Joe’s presentation and I highly recommend checking her out on Google. She is an amazing woman and I felt lucky to meet her in person.

I was excited about this event because it was organised by the United Nations. My dream is to work for the UN someday. I was grateful for the opportunity to meet, listen to, and discuss with the amazing women who I look up to doing great work across Nigeria.

I look forward to being back at the UN for more dialogues like that, especially on issues I am heavily invested in. I also look forward to joining the UN as a full-time employee someday.
