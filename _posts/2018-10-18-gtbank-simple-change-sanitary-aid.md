I actually screamed in delight when I found out two initiatives I volunteer for - Stand to End Rape and Sanitary Aid Initiative had each won 1 million naira from GTBank's Simple Change Big Impact Challenge. I was really excited because I knew we could reach out to more people with the money.

A few months later, Sanitary Aid purchased sanitary products with the money won and we were ready to reach out to young girls. Alakoto High School in Ajegunle, Lagos was one of the schools we visited and I had the opportunity to speak to 400 girls on menstrual hygiene and self-esteem. We gave out reusable pads and the girls had a lot of questions which were all answered. The boys were not left out as I also spoke to them about the destigmatization of menstruation. I am looking forward to more outreaches and I am extremely grateful to Guaranty Trust Bank for funding this.
