My friend and I were discussing, like we always do on the many topics we both find interesting and keen to solve issues in. On this day, we talked about the ills of the domestic services industry in Nigeria and decided to take action. We decided to found an organisation aimed at raising awareness of and tackling the problems faced by domestic workers in Nigeria. Here To Help Nigeria is the name of our organisation. Our overraching aim is to bring education to both formal and informal education to female domestic workers. We also aim to continually educate people on the abhorrent nature of child labour.

To find out more about the work we do, please visit our social media pages: [@here2help_ng](https://twitter.com/here2help_ng) on Twitter and [@here2help_ng](https://www.instagram.com/here2help_ng/) on Instagram.
