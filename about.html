	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Ganikale Ololade, a zealous human rights activist passionate about gender equality, educational advancement in Africa, poverty alleviation, and challenging the rape culture in our societies.</p>
	<p>I work with a number of NGOs solving some of the societal problems highlighted above. I am an Administrative Personnel for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanitaryaidng.com/">Sanitary Aid Nigeria</a> where our aim is to educate and provide free sanitary products to girls who do not have access to these products. We have raised more than a million Naira and have reached out to over 200 girls across Nigeria. I also volunteer for <a target="_blank" href="http://standtoendrape.org/">Stand To End Rape Initiative</a> where our mission is advocating against sexual violence, providing prevention mechanisms, and supporting survivors with psychosocial services. So far, we have reached to over a 100 communities in Nigeria and counting. <a target="_blank" data-cms-editor-link-style="undefined" href="http://www.slum2school.org/">Slum2School Africa</a> is another NGO I volunteer for. The aim of the organisation is to grant every child access to quality education, provide educational scholarships, support for disadvantaged children in slums and indigent communities.</p>
	<p>I have also co-founded two NGOs: <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/handsoffNG">Hands Off</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/here2help_ng">Here To Help Nigeria Initiative</a>. We founded Hands Off in 2018 in partnership with Stand To End Rape Initivate. Our primary goal is to end sexual harassment by going to schools across Nigeria, and educating boys and girls on consent, gender equality, and self defense. The overaching goal of Here To Help Nigeria Initiative is to ensure that all domestic workers are granted access to both formal and informal education while being treated fairly in the households where they work.</p>
	<p>In November 2016, my friend and I started a Christmas drive for the less privileged. We recruited volunteers through social media, who joined us on the streets on Christmas eve to feed the under-privileged, and provide them with clothing. We also initiated a medical outreach where adults underwent various tests for high blood pressure, blood sugar level, malaria, and typhoid. To date, we have reached out to over 400 children and 200 adults.</p>
	<p>I currently work as an Analyst at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webcoupers.com/">Webcoupers LLC</a> - a Google premier partner, digital marketing and consulting firm in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>
